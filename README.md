# Introduction to the Weather Web Application Project
With the increasing reliance on technology and the high demand for instant access to information, providing accurate and up-to-date weather data has become crucial. A weather web application is a tool that allows users to easily and efficiently access weather information through their electronic devices.
# APPLICATION features
Show current weather: The application displays detailed information about the current weather conditions in the user's geographical location or any other chosen location.
Interactive User Interface: The application is designed to be easy to use and visually attractive, with icons to improve visualization.
Real-time updates: The app relies on global weather services to fetch real-time data, ensuring the accuracy of the information provided.
# HTML
HTML is used to build the structure of pages and define the basic content of the application.
# CSS
CSS is used to style the look and layout of the application, including colors, fonts, and layouts.
# Javascript
JavaScript is used to make the application dynamic and interactive, enabling users to receive real-time weather updates.
# System Analysis for Weather Web Application
1. ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES :
Determine user requirements.
Determine basic system functions.
Outline of the system structure and its components.
Define interaction interfaces between the user and the system.
2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS :
Display current weather: Display temperature, sky conditions, wind speed, humidity and barometric pressure.
Geolocation: Allow users to manually enter location or use the device's geolocation.
Interactive User Interface: Design an attractive, easy-to-use interface with icons and graphs.
Real-time updates: Fetch and update weather data from global weather services in 
real-time.
3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS :
Performance: Ensure quick response and real-time data updates.
Ease of use: Providing a user-friendly interface with clear navigation.
Availability and Reliability: Ensure that the system is always available and that the data is reliable.
Security: Protection of user data and secure communication with weather services.
4. SYSTEM STRUCTURE :
User interface (UI): HTML pages, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity.
Weather services interaction: Use APIs to fetch and process weather data.
Data management: storing data temporarily and updating it periodically.
5.USE CASE SCENARIOS :
View current weather: Users open the app to see current weather conditions.
View future forecast: Users click on the forecast option to see the weather for the coming days.
Change location: Users enter a new location or use location to update weather information.
6. PROJECT GOAL :
This project aims to design a web application to provide updated and accurate information about weather and weather conditions using HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies. The application aims to provide an intuitive and attractive user interface for users to know temperature, wind speed, humidity and other relevant information.
